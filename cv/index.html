<h2>Profile</h2>
<p class="just">
My early career has been an intersection of physics, astronomy, and
computing. Throughout my undergraduate education in physics I worked
on extracurricular educational and scientific software and web
development projects. This evolved into seven years of full-time
software development and database design work at CERN during the
critical construction phase of the LHC experiment. There, I gained
skills and experience with complex scientific projects and distributed
computing systems, building databases to handle millions of hardware
tests and a data transfer system to handle petabytes of scientific
data. My transition to astrophysics went through the development of a
cluster-based analysis framework for the Dark Energy Survey, and on to
doctoral studies in solar physics and the long-term magnetic
variability of Sun-like stars. I now seek to build a career in
astrophysical research while leveraging my experience in software
development and large-scale computing systems.
